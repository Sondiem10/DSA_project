# Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)

## Overview
The Levenshtein distance (also known as edit distance) is a measure of the difference between two strings. It is defined as the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another. This problem is commonly used in various fields such as natural language processing, spell checkers, DNA sequence alignment, and more.

## Application
The Levenshtein distance is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Spell checking**: Finding the closest word suggestions for a misspelled word.
- **DNA sequence comparison**: Measuring genetic similarities by counting the minimum number of mutations.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Matching and comparing text in different contexts, such as sentence matching.
- **Text similarity**: Calculating how similar two strings are, which is useful in plagiarism detection, document clustering, etc.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the Levenshtein distance algorithm is **O(m * n)**, where:
- `m` is the length of the first string.
- `n` is the length of the second string.

This is because the algorithm involves filling out a 2D table of size `m x n`, where each cell is computed using a constant amount of work.

## Input Format
The input consists of two strings:
1. **String 1 (s1)**: The first string to be compared.
2. **String 2 (s2)**: The second string to be compared.

## Example Input
```plaintext
String 1: "kitten"
String 2: "sitting"
```

## Output Format
The output is an integer representing the Levenshtein distance (edit distance) between the two strings, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.

## Example Output
```plaintext
3
